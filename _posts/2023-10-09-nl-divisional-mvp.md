The player of the week in the NLDS was Bryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies. Many would argue Nick Castellanos, but the confidence and momentum Bryce provided throughout proved to be too much for the Braves to handle. 
After game 2 of the series, Orlando Arcia made comments about Harper being doubled up at first base to end the game. During game 3 with the series tied at one apiece, Harper hit 2 home runs and made sure to let Arcia know by staring him down and letting him hear it. After this, the Phillies never looked back with massive amounts of momentum playing behind a hostile home crowd and taking the series 3-1. Harper finished the series 6-13 at the plate with another 5 walks. He scored 5 times and added 5 RBI. Three of each of those came from a home run.

Spray Chart Action

This chart constructed in R studio shows the spray of each base hit that Alvarez had during the entire regular season. It is a great vision of what may be to come the rest of the playoffs, but overall, he hits the ball to all areas of the field making it hard to predict where he may hit the next one.

This chart constructed in R studio shows the spray of each ball put that Alvarez into play during the division series. This aligns with the regular season spray chart, and nothing looks out of the ordinary meaning he has been able to do a great job keeping the same approach. 

Strike Zone & Batted Ball Display

This chart shows each pitch that Alvarez put into play during the ALDS and what pitch it was. He has been able to keep a pretty tight strike zone and only contact pitches he can do damage with rather than letting the pitcher dictate what he hits.
