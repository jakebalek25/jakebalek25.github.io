The player of the week in the ALDS was Yordan Alvarez slugging at a historic rate. The Alvarez-Abreu punch in the Astros lineup proved to be too much for the Twins as either player couldâ€™ve been named the Player of the Week. However, Yordan is slugging at an all-time high percentage through the first series, and it is going to be very interesting to see if he can keep it up. His SLG % sits at 1.313 through 4 games in the 2023 playoffs after accumulating 4 home runs and 2 doubles along with a single in only 16 official at-bats.
