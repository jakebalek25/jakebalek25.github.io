Voting
------
Each year, MLB fans vote across multiple weeks to determine who should be starting in the allstar game. This year, the voting process occurs through 2 phases. The first phase allows fans to vote on every position including designated hitters. The top overall vote reciever in both leagues is granted an automatic starting spot at their postion. The rest of the positions advance to the final phase as fans are allowed to vote on the top 2 players at each position to secure a starting spot in the all star game. The same goes for outfielders however there are 3 spots and 6 players advance to phase 2. 

Along with years past, this format of allowing fans to vote for players has led a popularity contest. Today, I want to highlight who the batting starters should be based on WAR and multiple basic/advanced statistics rather than fan voting.

Above, the images contain players who have qualified for phase 2 of the voting according to MLB.com.

Next, we will get into who I believe should be the all-star starter for each position between the 2 leagues. I made judgements based simply on raw numbers from fangraphs and statcast. The data was then manipulated to determine the rank for each qualified player at the respected postions. The statistics being studied consist of Batting Average (AVG), Stolen Bases (SB), Home Runs (HR), weighted On Base Average (wOBA), Wins Above Replacement (WAR), weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Slugging Percentage (SLG) and On Base Percentage (OBP).

  </div>
</div>

Among the 85 catchers who have recorded an official at-bat in the MLB this year, there are only 10 qualified players at this postion. No one is more qualified to be the starter for the AL team as he leads Wins Above Replacement over all other catchers, edging the next closest AL catcher by 0.9 WAR. Among the qualified catchers, he ranks top 3 in Batting Average, weighted Runs Created Plus, Slugging Percentage and On Base Percentage to name a few. Although Salvador Perez is having a great season, no catcher in the AL is having a good enough season to be put into the same conversation as Rutschman. 

First Baseman - Vladimir Guerrero Jr.

Toronto Blue Jays #27

  </div>
</div>

Despite the Blue Jays offensive struggles, Valdimir Guerrero Jr. has quietly had a great start to the year. He is top 3 among first baseman in Batting Average, On Base Percentage and weighted Runs Created Plus. He has seen a slight drop in power however, he has made up for it by getting on base at a career best rate of 0.377 OBP. He ranks 5th among first basemen in WAR behind only Salvador Perez in the AL by a small margin. However, Guerrero has done a much better job getting on base and helping his team create a much higher number of runs than Perez. 

Second Baseman - Jose Altuve
------
Houston Astros #27

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 50%; margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="/images/altuve_image.png" style="width: 70%; height: auto; display: block;" alt="Illustration of Jose Altuve">

  </div>
</div>

The choice of Altuve in this situation was extremely difficult and likely the closest race among all of the other positions. Jordan Westburg slightly outranks Altuve in 4 of our main categories so he should be the starter correct? While he should be an all-star, I believe that Altuve should be the starter due to Altuve being the all around better hitter. Altuve has a much higher batting average and on base percentage than Westburg and has more steals to go with this. Altuve has been the perfect man for the Astros this year while adding some power. He has reached base safely at such a high rate that he has scored the third most runs among second basemen despite the Astros early struggles this season. Altuve shows more discipline at the plate than Westburg by walking more and striking out less than Westburg according to their walk and strikeout rates. Again, this was a tough choice however, I believe Altuve has done a better job in his leadoff role to keep the Astros in the thick of the playoff race. This is no knock to Westburg who has also done his job by driving in guys from the top of the order. 

Third Baseman - José Ramírez

Cleveland Guardians #11

  </div>
</div>

The selection of the starting AL third baseman is a tricky one. We could likely see 3 AL third basemen make the all-star team between José Ramírez, Jordan Westburg and Rafael Devers. All 3 have had phenomenal starts to the season however, José Ramírez and Rafael Devers stick out to me as the tier 1 players despite Devers not making the final phase of voting. You really cannot go wrong as to who is picked between these two despite the lack of media around the two players so far this season. For the purpose of selecting a starter, we will stick with José Ramírez due to his lead in WAR by just under half a point and his raw offensive numbers topping Devers. His high number of hits and RBI's have led Cleveland to one of the best offenses in baseball. This along with a stellar bullpen, has guided Cleveland to the best record across the MLB through the first half of the season. 

Shortstop - Gunnar Henderson

Baltimore Orioles #2

  </div>
</div>

The race for starting shortstop in the AL has been very close between the two best shortstops in the MLB so far this season between Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr. Gunnar has had the better overall season so far, trailing only in batting average and stealing numbers. Gunnar leads all qualified shortstops in Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement, weighted On Base Average and Home Runs among our selected statistics. Gunnar has held the position strong despite newcomer Jackson Holliday giving him a run for his money. Gunnar leads Bobby Witt Jr. by over a point in WAR and all other shortstops by over 2 full points!

Catcher - William Contreras

  </div>
</div>

William has had an offensive explosion in the first half of the season. He leads all of the qualified catchers in On Base Percentage and Batting Average. He is top 3 in both Wins Above Replacement and weighted Runs Created Plus. Contreras has helped the Brewers young pitching staff have one of the best starts in the league. There is lots of argument to have Will Smith above Contreras in this postition because Will Smith slightly edges Contreras in WAR by just under 0.005 due to a much better start to the year on the defensive side. However, this spot belongs to Contreras who has had the much better offensive start and all-around year so far.

First Baseman - Bryce Harper

Philadelphia Phillies #3

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 80%;">MLB hitting rankings among 26 other qualified first basemen in at-bats.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Bryce Harper is a clear cut all-star stater after the season he has gotten off to. He earned his place as a starter early after phase 1 and it was well deserved as he leads all other qualified first basemen in Batting Average, On Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus and Wins Above Replacement. He has been the best at his postion across the league and has helped lead the Phillies to the top spot in the NL throught the first half of the season. The only even remotely close is Freddie Freeman who ranks 2nd in most of the statistics listed above however, due to Bryce Harper's recent time on the IL, Freeman will likely replace Harper as a starter in the all-star game. 

Second Baseman - Ketel Marte
------
Arizona Diamondbacks #4

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 50%; margin-right: 10px;">

      <li>HT/WT: 6' 1", 210 lbs</li>
      <li>BIRTHDATE: 10/12/1993 (30)</li>
      <li>BAT/THR: Both/Right</li>
      <li>BIRTHPLACE: Nizao, Dominican Republic</li>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 80%;">MLB hitting rankings among 21 other qualified second basemen in at-bats.</p>
  </div>
</div>

The selection of Ketel Marte was an easy one as he is leading all other second basemen in WAR by more than a full point! the next closest NL second baseman is Brice Turang a full 1.2 WAR behind. Marte is having an extrodrordinary season at second base as he leads all others in Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement, weighted On Base Average and Home Runs! He has helped provide the Diamondbacks with an offensive explosion that no one at second base can compare to this season. 

Third Baseman - Alec Bohm

Philadelphia Phillies #28

      <li>BIRTHDATE: 8/3/1996 (27)</li>
      <li>BAT/THR: Right/Right</li>
      <li>BIRTHPLACE: Omaha, NE</li>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 80%;">MLB hitting rankings among 20 other qualified third basemen in at-bats.</p>
  </div>
</div>

This year, there hasn't been a star third baseman in the NL like there has the AL. The two final nominees in Alec Bohm and Manny Machado are... interesting. Machado ranks near the middle or bottom of all qualified third basemen in our offensive categories. Bohm is the best NL third baseman by quite a wide margin. Bohm is top 5 among all third basemen in Batting Average, On Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage. He ranks 6th in WAR as he has locked down the hot corner for the Phillies to begin the year and has the highest Offensive rating so far among all NL third basemen by quite a wide margin. He is very deserving as there is no one else who should really be in the conversation with him. 

Shortstop - Mookie Betts

Los Angeles Dodgers #13

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

  </div>
</div>

Mookie Betts started the year on an absolute tear, torching the league by hitting home runs every other night. He has since slightly cooled off however is still one of the top shortstops in the league so far. His competition resides in Trea Turner however, Turner is not considered to be a qualified hitter due to his time with injury. So, choosing Mookie Betts makes sense as Mookie has doubled Turner in most categories outside of batting average. Mookie has shown great numbers across the board and leads the NL in On Base Percentage which is exactly what the Dodgers have asked for out of their leadoff man. Mookie should be chosen the starter however, due to his recent hand fracture, Turner will likely end up starting the game.
