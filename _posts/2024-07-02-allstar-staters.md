# Voting
---
Each year, MLB fans vote over multiple weeks to determine who should start in the All-Star Game. This year, the voting process occurs in two phases. In the first phase, fans vote for every position, including designated hitters. The top overall vote-receiver in both leagues is granted an automatic starting spot at their position. The rest of the positions advance to the final phase, where fans vote on the top two players at each position to secure a starting spot in the All-Star Game. For outfielders, there are three spots, so six players advance to phase two.

As in previous years, this format of allowing fans to vote for players has led to a popularity contest. Today, I want to highlight who the batting starters should be based on WAR and various basic and advanced statistics rather than fan voting. Each position was determined based solely on qualified hitters who meet the minimum PA threshold, except for the OF position, which was set at a 250 AB minimum.

Above, the images contain players who have qualified for phase 2 of the voting according to MLB.com.

Next, we will explore who I believe should be the All-Star starter for each position in both leagues. My judgments are based solely on raw numbers from Fangraphs and Statcast. The data was manipulated to determine the rank for each qualified player at their respective positions. The statistics analyzed include Batting Average (AVG), Stolen Bases (SB), Home Runs (HR), weighted On Base Average (wOBA), Wins Above Replacement (WAR), weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and On Base Percentage (OBP).

  </div>
</div>

Among the 85 catchers who have recorded an official at-bat in the MLB this year, only 10 are qualified players at this position. No one is more qualified to be the starting catcher for the AL team than Adley Rutschman. He leads in Wins Above Replacement (WAR) over all other catchers, edging the next closest AL catcher by 0.9 WAR. Among the qualified catchers, he ranks in the top 3 for Batting Average (AVG), weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and On Base Percentage (OBP), to name a few. Although Salvador Perez is having a great season, no catcher in the AL is performing at the level of Rutschman.

First Baseman - Vladimir Guerrero Jr.

Toronto Blue Jays #27

  </div>
</div>

Despite the Blue Jays' offensive struggles, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has quietly had a great start to the year. He is top 3 among first basemen in Batting Average (AVG), On Base Percentage (OBP), and weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+). Although he has seen a slight drop in power, he has compensated by reaching base at a career-best rate of .377 OBP. Guerrero ranks 5th among first basemen in Wins Above Replacement (WAR), just behind Salvador Perez in the AL by a small margin. However, Guerrero has done a much better job getting on base and helping his team create a significantly higher number of runs than Perez.

Second Baseman - Jose Altuve
---
Houston Astros #27

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 50%; margin-right: 10px;">

  </div>
</div>

The choice of Altuve in this situation was extremely difficult and likely the closest race among all of the other positions. Jordan Westburg slightly outranks Altuve in 4 of our main categories so he should be the starter correct? While he should be an all-star, I believe that Altuve should be the starter due to Altuve being the all around better hitter. Altuve has a much higher batting average and on base percentage than Westburg and has more steals to go with this. Altuve has been the perfect man for the Astros this year while adding some power. He has reached base safely at such a high rate that he has scored the third most runs among second basemen despite the Astros early struggles this season. Altuve shows more discipline at the plate than Westburg by walking more and striking out less than Westburg according to their walk and strikeout rates. Again, this was a tough choice however, I believe Altuve has done a better job in his leadoff role to keep the Astros in the thick of the playoff race. This is no knock to Westburg who has also done his job by driving in guys from the top of the order. 

Third Baseman - José Ramírez

Cleveland Guardians #11

  </div>
</div>

The selection of the starting AL third baseman is a tricky one. We could likely see 3 AL third basemen make the all-star team between José Ramírez, Jordan Westburg and Rafael Devers. All 3 have had phenomenal starts to the season however, José Ramírez and Rafael Devers stick out to me as the tier 1 players despite Devers not making the final phase of voting. You really cannot go wrong as to who is picked between these two despite the lack of media around the two players so far this season. For the purpose of selecting a starter, we will stick with José Ramírez due to his lead in WAR by just under half a point and his raw offensive numbers topping Devers. His high number of hits and RBI's have led Cleveland to one of the best offenses in baseball. This along with a stellar bullpen, has guided Cleveland to the best record across the MLB through the first half of the season. 

Shortstop - Gunnar Henderson

Baltimore Orioles #2

  </div>
</div>

The race for starting shortstop in the AL has been very close between the two best shortstops in the MLB so far this season between Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr. Gunnar has had the better overall season so far, trailing only in batting average and stealing numbers. Gunnar leads all qualified shortstops in Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement, weighted On Base Average and Home Runs among our selected statistics. Gunnar has held the position strong despite newcomer Jackson Holliday giving him a run for his money. Gunnar leads Bobby Witt Jr. by over a point in WAR and all other shortstops by over 2 full points! This is good enough to be 2nd in the league just behind Aaron Judge.

Outfielder #1 - Aaron Judge

</div>

Aaron Judge is having another season similar to his MVP season in 2022. Despite his slow start, he leads all qualified outfielders in On Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement, weighted On Base Average and Home Runs out of our selected stats. He leads the entire MLB in WAR and is third among the outfielders in batting average at .321. He has completely electrified the Yankees offense alongside Juan Soto. There is nothing more that needs to be said about the best player in the league so far this year. He deserves to start the all-star game as he chases another MVP season and he was rightfully voted to start after phase 1. 

Outfielder #2 - Juan Soto
---
New York Yankees #22

  </div>
</div>

Similar to Aaron Judge, Juan Soto has been Mr. Consistent for the Yankees this season by hammering the ball to all parks of the park. At the beginning of the year when the Yankees offense was cold, Soto carried the offense on his back to jumpstart the team. Soto ranks 2nd among qualifying outfielders in On Base Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement and weighted On Base Average. He ranks top 5 in Batting Average and Slugging Percentage among qualified outfielders as well. He and Judge have completely torn the cover off the ball and deserve to start side-by-side in the all-star game. 

Outfielder #3 - Steven Kwan

  </div>
</div>

Steven Kwan season has been a bit of a surprise as to the magnitude of success he has had at the plate. Despite missing some time with injury, Kwan leads the league in batting average at .362 as of after yesterday. He ranks top 5 among all qualified outfielders in On Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement and weighted On Base Average. He is doing everything that Cleveland is asking of him in the leadoff spot by getting on base for the heart of the order. Alongside José Ramírez, Kwan has been a vital piece in acheiving first place in the MLB after the halfway mark this season. 

Designated Hitter - Yordan Alvarez

Yordan Alvarez has been a machine this year offensively. He ranks top 4 among all qualified designated hitters in Batting Average, On Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement, weighted On Base Average, Home Runs and even Stolen Bases. He has been getting it done throughout every aspect offensively. He is by far the best AL option at DH and was one of my considerations for an OF as well.

## Catcher - William Contreras
Milwaukee Brewers  #24

  </div>
</div>

William has had an offensive explosion in the first half of the season. He leads all of the qualified catchers in On Base Percentage and Batting Average. He is top 3 in both Wins Above Replacement and weighted Runs Created Plus. Contreras has helped the Brewers young pitching staff have one of the best starts in the league. There is lots of argument to have Will Smith above Contreras in this postition because Will Smith slightly edges Contreras in WAR by just under 0.005 due to a much better start to the year on the defensive side. However, this spot belongs to Contreras who has had the much better offensive start and all-around year so far.

First Baseman - Bryce Harper

Philadelphia Phillies #3

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 80%;">MLB hitting rankings among 26 other qualified first basemen in at-bats.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Bryce Harper is a clear cut all-star stater after the season he has gotten off to. He earned his place as a starter early after phase 1 and it was well deserved as he leads all other qualified first basemen in Batting Average, On Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus and Wins Above Replacement. He has been the best at his postion across the league and has helped lead the Phillies to the top spot in the NL throught the first half of the season. The only even remotely close is Freddie Freeman who ranks 2nd in most of the statistics listed above however, due to Bryce Harper's recent time on the IL, Freeman will likely replace Harper as a starter in the all-star game. 

Second Baseman - Ketel Marte

Arizona Diamondbacks #4

  </div>
</div>

The selection of Ketel Marte was an easy one as he is leading all other second basemen in WAR by more than a full point! the next closest NL second baseman is Brice Turang a full 1.2 WAR behind. Marte is having an extrodrordinary season at second base as he leads all others in Slugging Percentage, weighted Runs Created Plus, Wins Above Replacement, weighted On Base Average and Home Runs! He has helped provide the Diamondbacks with an offensive explosion that no one at second base can compare to this season.

  </div>
</div>

This year, there hasn't been a star third baseman in the NL like there has the AL. The two final nominees in Alec Bohm and Manny Machado are... interesting. Machado ranks near the middle or bottom of all qualified third basemen in our offensive categories. Bohm is the best NL third baseman by quite a wide margin. Bohm is top 5 among all third basemen in Batting Average, On Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage. He ranks 6th in WAR as he has locked down the hot corner for the Phillies to begin the year and has the highest Offensive rating so far among all NL third basemen by quite a wide margin. He is very deserving as there is no one else who should really be in the conversation with him.

Mookie Betts started the year on an absolute tear, torching the league by hitting home runs every other night. He has since slightly cooled off however is still one of the top shortstops in the league so far. His competition resides in Trea Turner however, Turner is not considered to be a qualified hitter due to his time with injury. So, choosing Mookie Betts makes sense as Mookie has doubled Turner in most categories outside of batting average. Mookie has shown great numbers across the board and leads the NL in On Base Percentage which is exactly what the Dodgers have asked for out of their leadoff man. Mookie should be chosen the starter however, due to his recent hand fracture, Turner will likely end up starting the game.

Without having to worry about pitching or playing the field this year, Shohei Ohtani has been the real deal at the plate. He is leading all qualified designated hitters in every single one of our selected statistics including Stolen Bases! He ranks 5th in WAR in the league this year solely from hitting. He has even taken on the role of batting leadoff recently for the Dodgers with Mookie Betts being placed on the IL. He has even excelled in that spot. He sits at 27 home runs so far this season and is pushing to break 60 home runs after a somewhat slow start. He is going to be pursuing another MVP in the 2nd half of the season.
