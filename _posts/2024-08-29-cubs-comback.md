# The Chicago Cubs Are On Fire: Can They Keep the Momentum Going?
Not enough people are talking about how hot the Chicago Cubs are right now. The Chicago Cubs are absolutely on fire right now! Over the past week, they’ve been hitting the ball like it’s nobody’s business, and it’s showing in the stats. With a team batting average of .333, they’re averaging more than 10 runs per game. That’s right—10 runs per game! The closest team in terms of runs during this stretch is the Detroit Tigers, but they’re trailing the Cubs by a whopping 29 runs. The Cubs have racked up an incredible 73 runs in just 7 games.

Above, the image contains players who have qualified for phase 2 of the voting according to MLB.com.

Next, we will explore who I believe should be the All-Star starter for each position in both leagues. My judgments are based solely on raw numbers from Fangraphs and Statcast. The data was manipulated to determine the rank for each qualified player at their respective positions. The statistics analyzed include Batting Average (AVG), Stolen Bases (SB), Home Runs (HR), weighted On Base Average (wOBA), Wins Above Replacement (WAR), weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and On Base Percentage (OBP).

Among the 85 catchers who have recorded an official at-bat in the MLB this year, only 10 are qualified players at this position. No one is more qualified to be the starting catcher for the AL team than Adley Rutschman. He leads in Wins Above Replacement (WAR) over all other catchers, edging the next closest AL catcher by 0.9 WAR. Among the qualified catchers, he ranks in the top 3 for Batting Average (AVG), weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and On Base Percentage (OBP), to name a few. Although Salvador Perez is having a great season, no catcher in the AL is performing at the level of Rutschman.
