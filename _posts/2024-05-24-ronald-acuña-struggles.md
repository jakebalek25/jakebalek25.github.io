As a fantasy owner of Ronald Acuña Jr. for 2 of the last 3 seasons, I must say it has been qutie fun. However, when I selected Acuña with the 1.1 pick in the draft this year, I had thought I would be recieving a top 10 player at worst. However, he has hovered around just outside top 100 fantasy players within my league and I am quite disappointed that I took him with the first overall pick.

Earlier this week I caught Anthony Recker, of MLB Network, breaking down one aspect relating to some of the struggles that Acuña has delt with to begin the year. The concept made me dive a little deeper into whether this was a true issue or not and I am quite surprised to say the least. This year, Acuña simply has not been on time for the fastball which is causing him to miss off-speed pitches as a result. 


Comparing Seasons
------
During last season when Acuña won MVP, his statistics were out of this world and extremely better in most categories than every year previous within his career. He had career highs in Home Runs, Runs Scored, Runs Batted In, Stolen Bases, Batting Average, On Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage to name a few. This can be somewhat attributed to his swing timing. He was never late on a fastball which generated lots of power and ultimately home runs to both sides of the field. This year however, he has had trouble with the timing of fastballs which is causing him to swing through more fastballs than he would like.

When Acuña misses a fastball, he is then forcing himself to hit offspeed when behind in the count. Hitters tend to struggle more often than in early fastball counts including him. He has been guessing on which pitch may be coming and is off on timing because he cannot properly adjust to offspeed.

In the illustration, you notice the metric wFA per 100. The metric measures the batter's average amount of runs produced against 100 fastballs thrown. The number 0 being average as it takes into account change in run expectancy per fastball thrown to the hitter. In this scenario, Acuña has never had a season in which he wasn't above average. We can see his value per 100 fastballs last year was extremely high resulting in a career high in total wFA throughout the year. This year however, Acuña is much below average and is nearing a value of negative 2 putting him near the bottom of the league. 

As a result, he is seeing many more fastballs this year than he did in the past at 6% more than 2023 because pitchers are beginning to see that they can use this against him.

Why is Acuña struggling?
------

Well, Acuña returned late to spring training, just 2 weeks before Opening Day, this year because he had felt slight soreness in his surgically repaired right knee. Could he simply be off to a slow start because he isn't seeing the ball well or is he worried about maybe reinjuring his knee? We will only see how this plays out with time. However, Acuña needs to get his fastball timing back or he is going to continue to struggle at even higher rates as more pitchers and teams across the league begin to learn how to take advantage of him.

So far this season his stats are very similar to previous years of his career. The two that stick out are his strikeout percentage and slugging percentage. His strikeout tendencies are extremely similar to the year before he won MVP. However, he is currently at a career low slugging percentage roughly a third of the way through the season.

Hopefully last year wasn't simply a fluke as Acuña has too much talent for this to be true. We will only see how this plays out with time. However, Acuña needs to get his fastball timing back or he is going to continue to struggle at even higher rates as more pitchers and teams across the league begin to learn how to take advantage of him at the plate.
