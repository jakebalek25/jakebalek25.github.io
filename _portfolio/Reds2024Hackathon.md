The Cincinnati Reds ran a competition for the first time in 2024 allowing students to submit their responses in relation to a topic they selected. The topic this year asked students to identify characteristics pf pitchers that lead to their success in specific roles, such as a traditional “starting pitcher”, a traditional “relief pitcher”, or any other pitching roles established within your the analysis. After identifying the different roles, then use the findings to determine which MLB pitchers may be better off suited in a different role and why. 

My group decided to use hierarchical agglomerative clusterting in attempt to categorize the pitcher archetypes. We ultimately finished as a finalist and I expanded my knowledge of modeling and data manipulation greatly.
