Currently in my senior year as an undergraduate student at Syracuse University.

Pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Sports Analytics and a minor in Data Analytics.

Previously worked with data across all major sports and their derivation through predictive modeling. 

My favorite sport data is baseball.
