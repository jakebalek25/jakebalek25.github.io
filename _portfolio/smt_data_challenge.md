# Uncovering Pre-Pitch Movements by Shortstops Revealing Pitch Tendencies

## Abstract
In baseball, pre-pitch movements by fielders, particularly shortstops, play a crucial role in optimizing positioning and readiness. These movements may also reveal clues about upcoming pitch attributes, potentially providing hitters with a predictive advantage. With little to no previous research published on this topic, there is ground to be gained for MLB teams in conducting research on whether pre-pitch movements do tip pitch attribute tendencies. This study addresses the research gap by analyzing pre-pitch movements by shortstops to determine if they offer insights into the predictability of pitch attributes such as pitch location, pitch type, and vertical break. 

The data provided by the SMT 2024 Data Challenge included ball and player tracking across nearly a season and a half for multiple levels of baseball within a single anonymous organization. To manage complexity, the analysis focused on one level of baseball and focused solely on the shortstop position. Pre-pitch movements were assessed for their predictive power regarding pitch attributes.

The assessment was done using Generalized Linear Models, with separate analysis done for right-handed and left-handed batters. Results indicated that pre-pitch movements do indeed offer modest predictive value for pitch location and pitch type in particular, with models for right-handed hitters performing better than left-handed. The study found that, although better than randomly guessing at an upcoming pitch, the predictions are not highly reliable. Overall, though, the movements by shortstops can offer hitters a slight potential area in predicting a pitches attribute.

The findings highlight the need for further research with the proper data into how different fieldersâ€™ pre-pitch movements might signal either pitch attributes or pitch types, emphasizing the importance of analyzing detailed fielding routines and coaching practices.

## Introduction
In baseball, a pre-pitch movement allows fielders to optimize positioning and readiness, significantly impacting their ability to make plays effectively. According to Diamond Dreams Baseball Academy, players develop a strategy for reacting if the ball is put into play. Infielders, especially shortstops, use foot movement and stances to adjust their readiness based on pitch signals.

However, there is limited research on whether these pre-pitch movements tip pitch tendencies to the batter. This leads us to the question, do pre-pitch movement tendencies by shortstops provide clues about the attributes of an upcoming pitch? Through a detailed analysis of pre pitch movements and pitch type outcomes, this research demonstrates that specific movement patterns can be associated with pitch types and locations, thus offering a predictive advantage for hitters.
