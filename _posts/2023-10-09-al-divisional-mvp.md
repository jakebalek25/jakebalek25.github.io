The player of the week in the ALDS was Yordan Alvarez slugging at a historic rate. The Alvarez-Abreu punch in the Astros lineup proved to be too much for the Twins as either player couldâ€™ve been named the Player of the Week. However, Yordan is slugging at an all-time high percentage through the first series, and it is going to be very interesting to see if he can keep it up. His SLG % sits at 1.313 through 4 games in the 2023 playoffs after accumulating 4 home runs and 2 doubles along with a single in only 16 official at-bats.

Spray Chart Action

(/images/Yordan_Season_Spray.png)
This chart constructed in R studio shows the spray of each base hit that Alvarez had during the entire regular season. It is a great vision of what may be to come the rest of the playoffs, but overall, he hits the ball to all areas of the field making it hard to predict where he may hit the next one.

This chart constructed in R studio shows the spray of each ball put that Alvarez into play during the division series. This aligns with the regular season spray chart, and nothing looks out of the ordinary meaning he has been able to do a great job keeping the same approach.
