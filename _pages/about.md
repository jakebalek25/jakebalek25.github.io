Currently in my junior year as an undergraduate student at Syracuse University.

Pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Sports Analytics and a minor in Data Analytics.

My research interests include baseball statistics and their derivation through predictive modeling.
  

Experience
======
Outside of my personal research, collaboration on unique projects with peers has provided valuable experience and further tools to bring to the workplace.
 
## Columbus Blue Jackets
During the 2023 fall, I worked with a group of 6 other Syracuse University students to tackle a massive data set provided to us by the Columbus Blue Jackets. This project was confidential, however I can share a few details!

We worked with survey data from the 2022 season and broke down each aspect of the set so it could be easily understood by anyone with a non-analytical background. We were then lucky enough to be able to present our findings to the staff and provided with suggestions for the future on ways to improve. 

It was a great experience because I was able to work with large amounts of raw data and take the project any way that I wanted. Overall, a great experience and my findings came out great!


 

## Assisting Professor with Predictions
After the 2023 MLB season, my professor Jeremy Losak, provided a few students at Syracuse University with a set of predictions. These predictions were based on the rule changes set into place during the 2023 season. 

The predictions and findings have been presented to media, so unfortunately I cannot share any exact details quite yet, but I can share some of the process we took to complete the objective!

A group of 5 Syracuse students provided my partner and I with data sets unique to each of the predictions. We then analyzed the data based on the predicitons to determine whether the outcome of each rule change correlated to each of the predictions. Using R Studio, Excel, and Tablaeu we were able to calculate different metrics and compare them to years past to determine whether the game had truly been changed. 

Once we had determined the outcome of each of the predictions, we made visuals to represent what the data showed in correlation to previous years before the rule change. We took each of the visuals and made a presentation that was ultimately sent to various media outlets. 

The project heightened different R studio abilities for myself and I was able to work with someone else's predictions in which I had never thought about some before. The experience was great as I added more to my toolbox and opened my mind to the different rule changes over the years within the MLB.
