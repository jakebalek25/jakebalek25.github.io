During the offseason prior to the 2024 season, the Cleveland Guardians decided to put forward a series of renovations accross the stadium. One included their upper deck of seats in right field being revamped to create a new group outing space. This removed an old series of walls and seats, switching to a more open and social look with more access to concession stands.
