This week, while watching the Chicago Cubs play the Pittsburgh Pirates, I couldn't help but think about how hitters approach situations when there is a runner on second base with no outs. The Cubs had little success during the regular 9 innings. However, in extras they were able to score quite easily. I had a couple ideas and questions about the situation. 
- Is the goal different in extra innings versus during the regular 9 innings? In extra innings, teams are more focused on scoring the runner on second rather than extending an inning. Does this change how teams approach the situation such as electing to sacrifice the runner over more often? 
- When not sacrificing, o hitters try to hit the ball to the outfield or on the ground more often? How often are hitters successful?

Using play-by-play Baseball Savant data spanning from 2020-2023, I was able to prepare some visuals to better understand how hitters have performed in this situation.

The rule of a runner starting on second base was implimented in the 2020 shortened season and ultimately fully adopted later.
