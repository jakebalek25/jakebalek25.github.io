This week, while watching the Chicago Cubs play the Pittsburgh Pirates, I couldn't help but think about how hitters approach situations when there is a runner on second base with no outs. The Cubs had little success during the regular 9 innings. However, in extras they were able to score quite easily. I had a couple ideas and questions about the situation. 
- In extra innings, teams are more focused on scoring the runner on second rather than extending an inning. Does this change how teams approach the situation such as electing to sacrifice the runner over more often? 
- When not sacrificing, do hitters try to hit the ball to the outfield or on the ground more often?
- How often are hitters successful in this situation?

Using play-by-play Baseball Savant data spanning from 2020-2023, I was able to prepare some visuals to better understand how hitters have performed in this situation. This study only examines situations in which there is a runner solely on 2nd base with 0 outs to mimmick the start of an extra inning. The goal is to determine how teams and hitters decide to play the situation differently in extra innings versus a regular inning. 

Regular Innings
------
The goal of any team during the regular 9 innings during a typical baseball game is to extend an inning as long as they can in order to score more runs. It may almost seem as though sacrificing a runner to third by bunt is a waste of an out so many teams decide not to put this play into action. Therefore, hitters are called upon to produce a successful at-bat and either score the runner or hit the runner to third base while trying to reach base.

Extra Innings

The rule of a runner starting on second base was implimented in the 2020 shortened season and ultimately fully adopted later.
