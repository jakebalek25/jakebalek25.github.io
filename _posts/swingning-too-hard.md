This year, the MLB has implimented new bat-tracking technology which allows us to understand how hard each player swings. We can then compare this to the rest of their stats to see why or how something may be occurring. Something that I found to be intriguing recently was the bat speed statistic alongside strikeout numbers. The two show eerily similar lists outside of a few oddities.  
This year, as you take a look at some of the strikeout numbers across the league, you may notice some big names near the top of the list such as the reigning NL MVP, 
Ronal Acuna or even Giancarlo Stanton. What's interesting however, is that when you compare the swing speed to the strikeout leaders across the league, they seem to 
have lots in common which begs the question: do the two have any correlation?
