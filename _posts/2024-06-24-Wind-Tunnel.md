During the offseason prior to the 2024 season, the Cleveland Guardians decided to put forward a series of renovations accross the stadium. One included their upper deck of seats in right field being revamped to create a new group outing space. This removed an old series of walls and seats, switching to a more open and social look with more access to concession stands.

The Cleveland offense has seen a surge in power numbers across the board and many are beginning to wonder whether this can be attributed to a possible wind tunnel having been created due to the renovations in right field. Many other wonder whether the success can simply be attributed for by an improvement in Cleveland offense from offseason work ethic and improvement. 

Offensive Numbers 
------
This year, Cleveland has clearly been more effective when hitting for power compared to last season which has led them to a top 3 record across the league through their first 75 games. At home, Cleveland is scoring an average of 5.17 runs per game during the 2024 season which as an increase of 1.38 when compared to 2023. On the road, they are scoring 4.95 runs per game in 2024 which is also an increase from last year but only by 0.57 runs. We see a much larger increase of runs per game coming at home. What can this be attributed to?

This year at home, Cleveland is hitting 1.4 home runs per game as opposed to 0.67 home runs in 2023. On the road, they are hitting 0.975 home runs per game in 2024 as opposed to 0.86 in 2023 so we do see another small increase however this doesn't stand out nearly as much as the increase in home runs per game at home. 

Cleveland's most impressive statistic is their Slugging percentage at home during the 2024 season. They rank 9th best in the MLB at home with a 0.422 SLG. This is an increase in 0.045 from 2023!
They generate this high SLG with mainly home runs as they are last in the MLB at recording 3B and 1B. According to Statcast, the Guardians are in the bottom 2 rankings for both barrel percentage and hard hit percentage across the MLB. 


Pitching Numbers
