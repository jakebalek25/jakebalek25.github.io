As a fantasy owner of Ronald Acuña including 2 of the last 3 seasons, I must say it has been qutie fun. However, when I selected Acuña with the 1.1 pick in the draft,
I had thought I would be recieving a top 10 player at worst. This year, he has hovered around just outside top 100 fantasy players within my league and I must say I 
am quite disappointed that I took him with the first overall pick rather than choosing someone else such as Mookie Betts.

Earlier this week I caught Anthony Recker, of MLB Network, breaking down one aspect relating to some of the struggles that Acuña has delt with to begin the year. It 
made me dive a little deeper into whether this was a true issue or not and I am quite surprised to say the least. This year, Acuña simply has not been on time for 
the fastball which is causing him to miss off-speed pitches as a result.
